# Epic-Snake
EpicSnake, a project that reimagines a classic game from my childhood. It includes features such as a skin menu, a jungle-themed musical ambiance, a retro style, points, and enemies. This project was developed using C++ and libraries like SFML with a focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
